Highlights:

- A FEEC framework for systematic discretization of port-Hamiltonian systems.

- The method leads to an exact discrete power balance and conservation laws.

- No need for a discrete Hodge nor dual meshes.

- Easy implementation via Firedrake or Fenics

- Numerical validation on 3D wave and Maxwell equations.
