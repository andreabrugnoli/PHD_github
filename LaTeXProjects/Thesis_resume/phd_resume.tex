The port-Hamiltonian approach has gained more and more visibility and popularity in the last two decades. Given its multiphysics character and structured description of a multitude of phenomena. it provides a unified framework to model, analyze and control both finite- and infinite-dimensional systems. Despite the large literature on this topic, elasticity problems have rarely been taken upon consideration. This thesis represents a bridge between port-Hamiltonian distributed systems and elasticity problems. The first challenge consisted in formulating
