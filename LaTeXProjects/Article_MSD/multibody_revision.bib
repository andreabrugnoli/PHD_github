Spatial dependence is suppressed by using the extended Galerkin method. A torque profile is used to drive the rotating body so that the rigid body motion is not known a priori. The effect of the coupling terms upon the vibration waveforms are investigated by using both a linearized analysis and numerical solution of the differential equations. It is found that for small values of the ratio of the flexible beam and rigid shaft inertia uncoupled equations can lead to substantially incorrect results, particularly with regard to frequencies."

Although the viewpoint presented is that of a mathematician, the paper is aimed at practitioners and the mathematical prerequisites are kept to a minimum. A classification of variational principles and of the corresponding weak formulations and Galerkin methods—displacement, equilibrium and mixed—is given and illustrated through four significant examples. The advantages and disadvantages of mixed methods are discussed. The concepts of convergence, approximability and stability and their interrelations are developed, and a résumé is given of the stability theory which governs the performance of mixed methods. The paper concludes with a survey of techniques that have been developed for the construction of stable mixed methods and numerous examples of such methods."

	abstract = "The formulation for the dynamic analysis of flexible multi-body systems that undergo large rigid body motion, leads to geometrically non-linear inertia properties due to large rotations. These inertia non-linearities that represent the coupling between gross rigid body motion and small elastic deformation, are dependent on the assumed displacement field. As alternatives to the finite element methods, deformable body shape functions and shape vectors are commonly employed to describe elastic deformation of linear structures. In this paper, substructure shape functions and shape vectors are used to describe elastic deformation of non-linear inertia-variant multi-body systems. This leads to two different representations of inertia nonlinearities; one is based on a consistent mass formulation, while the other is a lumped mass technique. The multi-body systems considered are collections of interconnected rigid and flexible bodies. Open and closed loop systems are permitted."

	abstract = "This paper describes a dynamic formulation of a straight beam finite element in the setting of the special Euclidean group SE(3). First, the static and dynamic equilibrium equations are derived in this framework from variational principles. Then, a non-linear interpolation formula using the exponential map is introduced. It is shown that this framework leads to a natural coupling in the interpolation of the position and rotation variables. Next, the discretized internal and inertia forces are developed. The semi-discrete equations of motion take the form of a second-order ordinary differential equation on a Lie group, which is solved using a Lie group time integration scheme. It is remarkable that no parameterization of the nodal variables needs to be introduced and that the proposed Lie group framework leads to a compact and easy-to-implement formulation. Some important numerical and theoretical aspects leading to a computationally efficient strategy are highlighted and discussed. For instance, the formulation leads to invariant tangent stiffness and mass matrices under rigid body motions and a locking free element. The proposed formulation is successfully tested in several numerical static and dynamic examples."

How to find an efficient accurate dynamics modeling method and its stable reliable numerical solving algorithm are the two core problems of flexible MSD. In this paper, the research status of modeling methods of flexible MSD in recent years is summarized first, including the selection of reference frames, the flexible body's kinematics descriptions, the deductions of dynamics equation, the model reduction techniques and the modeling methods of the contact/collision, uncertainty and multi-field coupling problems. Then, numerical solution technologies and their latest developments of flexible MSD are discussed in detail.

	abstract = {Abstract Flexible multibody systems are governed by sets of non-linear differential-algebraic equations (DAE). The number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) required for accurate body flexibility modeling, as well as the presence of the algebraic constraint equations limit the simulation speed. Body-level model reduction and general-purpose system-level model reduction techniques do not result in optimal model dimension reduction and do not necessarily transform the DAE-set into a cheaper to solve set of ordinary differential equations, as opposed to model reduction techniques, such as Global Modal Parameterization (GMP), which are based on describing the system motion by the contribution of its dominant (configuration-dependent) system-level modal patterns. Their use as a simulation tool has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper investigates the influence of the modal content of the configuration-dependent mode set on the simulation accuracy through numerical experiments. By including the dynamically excited eigenmodes and static deformation patterns for DOFs in which the system is externally loaded, the system can be accurately represented by a very limited number of DOFs. Phenomena such as mode veering and mode crossing, in which the modal content of eigenmodes rapidly varies, can be expected to be problematic for such a description, which is confirmed with numerical experiments.
