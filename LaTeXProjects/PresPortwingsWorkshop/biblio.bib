	abstract = {We present a finite element methodology tailored for the simulation of pulsatile flow in the full aorta and sinus of Valsalva interacting with highly deformable thin leaflets. We describe an extension of the so-called “Resistive Immersed Surface” method. To circumvent stability issues resulting from the bad conditioning of the linear system, especially when flow and geometry become complex after the inclusion of the aorta, we use a Lagrange multiplier technique that couples the dynamics of valve and flow. A banded level set variant allows to address the singularity of the resulting linear system while featuring, in addition to the parallel implementation, higher accuracy and an affordable computational burden. High-fidelity computational geometries are built and simulations are performed under physiological conditions. Several numerical experiments illustrate the ability of the model to capture the basic fluidic phenomena in both healthy and pathological configurations. We finally examine numerically the flow dynamics in the sinus of Valsalva after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation. We show numerically that flow may be subject to stagnation in the lower part of the sinuses. We highlight the far-reaching implications of this phenomenon and we hope inciting adequate studies to further investigate its potential clinical consequences.}

The class of considered systems are hyperbolic systems of two conservation laws in arbitrary spatial dimension and geometries. For these systems, a partitioned finite element method (PFEM) is derived, based on the integration by parts of one of the two conservation laws written in weak form. The non-linear one-dimensional shallow-water equation (SWE) is first considered as a motivation example. Then, the method is investigated on the example of the non-linear two-dimensional SWE. Complete derivation of the reduced finite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian system (pHs) is provided and numerical experiments are performed. Extensions to curvilinear (polar) coordinate systems, space-varying coefficients and higher-order pHs (Euler–Bernoulli beam equation) are provided.}",

	abstract = {Energy balance equations are established for the Newmark time integration algorithm, and for the derived algorithms with algorithmic damping introduced via averaging, the so-called α-methods. The energy balance equations form a sequence applicable to: Newmark integration of the undamped equations of motion, an extended form including structural damping, and finally the generalized form including structural as well as algorithmic damping. In all three cases the expression for energy, appearing in the balance equation, is the mechanical energy plus some additional terms generated by the discretization by the algorithm. The magnitude and character of these terms as well as the associated damping terms are discussed in relation to energy conservation and stability of the algorithms. It is demonstrated that the additional terms in the energy lead to periodic fluctuations of the mechanical energy and are the cause of the phenomenon of response ‘overshoot’, previously observed empirically in the application of Newmark based algorithms to high-frequency components. It is also demonstrated that the stability limit of the explicit Newmark algorithm is reached, when the stiffness term in the algorithmic energy vanishes, and that energy fluctuations take place for integration intervals close to the stability limit.}
