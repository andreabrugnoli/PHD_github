	abstract={We present a finite element variational integrator for compressible flows. The numerical scheme is derived by discretizing, in a structure-preserving way, the Lie group formulation of fluid dynamics on diffeomorphism groups and the associated variational principles. Given a triangulation on the fluid domain, the discrete group of diffeomorphisms is defined as a certain subgroup of the group of linear isomorphisms of a finite element space of functions. In this setting, discrete vector fields correspond to a certain subspace of the Lie algebra of this group. This subspace is shown to be isomorphic to a Raviart--Thomas finite element space. The resulting finite element discretization corresponds to a weak form of the compressible fluid equation that does not seem to have been used in the finite element literature. It extends previous work done on incompressible flows and at the lowest order on compressible flows. We illustrate the conservation properties of the scheme with some numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the basic concepts for physics-compatible discretization techniques. The paper gives a clear distinction between vectors and forms. Based on the difference between forms and pseudo-forms and the ⋆-operator which switches between the two, a dual grid description and a single grid description are presented. The dual grid method resembles a staggered finite volume method, whereas the single grid approach shows a strong resemblance with a finite element method. Both approaches are compared for the Poisson equation for volume forms. By defining a suitably weighted inner product for 1-forms this approach can readily be applied to anisotropic diffusion models for volume forms.}
