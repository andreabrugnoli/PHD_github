The reduced order model (ROM) is based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), where a reduced basis is formed using energy dominant POD modes. The reduced basis also consists of characteristics POD time modes that are derived from the POD time modes (coefficients) by using their periodicity. In addition to flow variables, the solution state vector comprises the mesh deformation, taking into account the structural deformation in FSI. A ROM solution is obtained by performing a linear interpolation of the reduced basis for changing operating/control parameters. The proposed Galerkin-free POD-ROM approach is demonstrated in terms of two test cases: a canonical case study of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a cylinder at Reynolds number Re=100, where simulations are performed for various structural-to-fluid mass ratios; and a shock wave boundary layer induced panel flutter. For the second case, we use previously computed high-fidelity simulations, considering only the effect of panel thickness on the aeroelastic coupling between the flexible panel and shock wave boundary layer interaction (SWBLI); the inflow is at Mach 2 and Reynolds number based on panel length Rea=50000. The presented Galerking-free ROM procedure is clean and robust for large mesh deformations, in addition to a significantly lower cost of computation compared to the FSI high-fidelity simulations.}

The model is based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation method. The method is independent of the governing equations, therefore, it does not require modifications to the source code. This is the first time that a NIROM was constructed for FSI phenomena using POD and RBF interpolation method. Another novelty of this work is the first implementation of the FSI NIROM under the framework of an unstructured mesh finite element multi-phase model (Fluidity) and a combined finite-discrete element method based solid model (Y2D). The capability of this new NIROM for FSI is numerically illustrated in three coupling simulations: a one-way coupling case (flow past a cylinder), a two-way coupling case (a free-falling cylinder in water) and a vortex-induced vibration of an elastic beam test case. It is shown that the FSI NIROM results in a large CPU time reduction by several orders of magnitude while the dominant details of the high fidelity model are captured.}

New developments have been proposed in order to examine nonlinear systems, among which the theory based on nonlinear normal modes is indubitably the most appealing. In this paper, a different approach is adopted, and proper orthogonal decomposition is considered. The modes extracted from the decomposition may serve two purposes, namely order reduction by projecting high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space and feature extraction by revealing relevant but unexpected structure hidden in the data. The utility of the method for dynamic characterization and order reduction of linear and nonlinear mechanical systems is demonstrated in this study.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations on fluid dynamics problems primarily rely on spatially or/and temporally discretization of the governing equation using polynomials into a finite-dimensional algebraic system. Due to the multi-scale nature of the physics and sensitivity from meshing a complicated geometry, such process can be computational prohibitive for most real-time applications (e.g., clinical diagnosis and surgery planning) and many-query analyses (e.g., optimization design and uncertainty quantification). Therefore, developing a cost-effective surrogate model is of great practical significance. Deep learning (DL) has shown new promises for surrogate modeling due to its capability of handling strong nonlinearity and high dimensionality. However, the off-the-shelf DL architectures, success of which heavily relies on the large amount of training data and interpolatory nature of the problem, fail to operate when the data becomes sparse. Unfortunately, data is often insufficient in most parametric fluid dynamics problems since each data point in the parameter space requires an expensive numerical simulation based on the first principle, e.g., Navier–Stokes equations. In this paper, we provide a physics-constrained DL approach for surrogate modeling of fluid flows without relying on any simulation data. Specifically, a structured deep neural network (DNN) architecture is devised to enforce the initial and boundary conditions, and the governing partial differential equations (i.e., Navier–Stokes equations) are incorporated into the loss of the DNN to drive the training. Numerical experiments are conducted on a number of internal flows relevant to hemodynamics applications, and the forward propagation of uncertainties in fluid properties and domain geometry is studied as well. The results show excellent agreement on the flow field and forward-propagated uncertainties between the DL surrogate approximations and the first-principle numerical simulations.}

This approach eliminates conflicting definitions, covers both autonomous and time-dependent systems and provides exact mathematical existence, uniqueness and robustness results. In this setting, a nonlinear normal mode (NNM) is a set filled with small-amplitude recurrent motions: a fixed point, a periodic orbit or the closure of a quasiperiodic orbit. In contrast, a spectral submanifold (SSM) is an invariant manifold asymptotic to a NNM, serving as the smoothest nonlinear continuation of a spectral subspace of the linearized system along the NNM. The existence and uniqueness of SSMs turns out to depend on a spectral quotient computed from the real part of the spectrum of the linearized system. This quotient may well be large even for small dissipation; thus, the inclusion of damping is essential for firm conclusions about NNMs, SSMs and the reduced-order models they yield.},

	abstract={Invariant manifolds are important constructs for the quantitative and qualitative understanding of nonlinear phenomena in dynamical systems. In nonlinear damped mechanical systems, for instance, spectral submanifolds have emerged as useful tools for the computation of forced response curves, backbone curves, detached resonance curves (isolas) via exact reduced-order models. For conservative nonlinear mechanical systems, Lyapunov subcenter manifolds and their reduced dynamics provide a way to identify nonlinear amplitude--frequency relationships in the form of conservative backbone curves. Despite these powerful predictions offered by invariant manifolds, their use has largely been limited to low-dimensional academic examples. This is because several challenges render their computation unfeasible for realistic engineering structures described by finite element models. In this work, we address these computational challenges and develop methods for computing invariant manifolds and their reduced dynamics in very high-dimensional nonlinear systems arising from spatial discretization of the governing partial differential equations. We illustrate our computational algorithms on finite element models of mechanical structures that range from a simple beam containing tens of degrees of freedom to an aircraft wing containing more than a hundred--thousand degrees of freedom.},

	abstract={One of the most ambitious projects in communications in recent years is the development of the so-called satellite mega-constellations. Comprised of hundreds or thousands of small and low-cost satellites, they aim to provide internet services in places without existing broadband access. For the antenna subsystem, reflectarrays have been proposed as a cheap solution due to their low profile and manufacturing costs, while still providing good performance. This paper presents a full design of a reflectarray antenna for mega-constellation satellites with a shaped-beam isoflux pattern for constant power flux in the surface of the Earth. A unit cell consisting of two stacked rectangular microstrip patches backed by a ground plane is employed, providing more than 360{\textdegree} of phase-shift. The generalized intersection approach optimization algorithm is employed to synthesize the required isoflux pattern in a 2 GHz bandwidth in Ku-band. To that purpose, a full-wave electromagnetic analysis is employed for the wideband design. The optimized reflectarray layout complies with the specifications of the isoflux pattern in the frequency band 16 GHz--18 GHz, demonstrating the capabilities of this type of antenna to provide a low-cost, low-profile solution for the user beam segment, including different types of shaped beams.},

In the numerical solution, the optimization problem is solved with a gradient-based solution algorithm. The nonlinear subproblems of the FSI forward problem are solved with a Newton method including line search. Specifically, we will formally provide the backward-in-time running adjoint state used for gradient computations.

When this condition is satisfied, the scaling problem of the model can be treated as a structural design problem only, where the scaled aerodynamic shape is preserved. If, on the other hand, this hypothesis no longer holds---if the scaled model is constrained to fly at low speed and low altitude, for example---and both the aerodynamic shape and the flexibility of the structure are exactly scaled, then the static response exhibits significant discrepancies in the aerodynamic loads and structural displacement. To design a flying demonstrator with scaled static response when flow similarity cannot be fulfilled, we present a multidisciplinary optimization-based method that allows some freedom in the design of the wing shape (while keeping the scaled wingspan) to update the wing geometry and structural properties to ensure equivalent scaled loads and overall wing displacement. To illustrate this method, we apply it to a 1:5 version of the uCRM wing at subsonic flight condition. While the errors in air loads using the classical theory are around 16{\%}, the presented method achieves errors lower than 1{\%}, with a good agreement for the wingtip displacement.},
