	abstract = {In this paper we envision how to tackle a particularly challenging problem which presents highly interdisciplinary features, ranging from biology to engineering: the dynamic description and technological realisation of flapping flight. This document explains why, in order to gain new insights into this topic, we chose to employ port-Hamiltonian theory. We discuss how the physically unifying character of the framework is able to describe flapping dynamics in all its important aspects. The technological and theoretical challenges of flapping flight are discussed by considering the interplay between different topics. First of all, the formal conceptualisation of the problem is analysed. Second, the features and capabilities of port-Hamiltonian framework as the underneath mathematical language are presented. Subsequently, the discretisation of the resulting model by means of structure-preserving strategies is addressed. Once a reliable numerical model is available, we discuss how control actions can be computed based on high-level specifications aiming at increasing the flight performances. In the last part, the technological tools needed to validate experimentally the models and to equip a robotic bird prototype with the necessary sensing and actuation devices are discussed.}
