	abstract={Mathematical modeling and simulation are moving from being powerful development and analysis tools towards having increased roles in operational monitoring, control and decision support, in which models of specific entities are continually updated in the form of a digital twin. However, current digital twins are largely the result of bespoke technical solutions that are difficult to scale. We discuss two exemplar applications that motivate challenges and opportunities for scaling digital twins, and that underscore potential barriers to wider adoption of this technology.},
