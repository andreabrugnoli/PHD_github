The integrated design methodology needs an accurate LFT representation of spacecraft flexible appendages so that parametric variations can be included. This requirement can be met using the Interconnected Flexible Appendage model studied in Perez et al. (2015). The model suitability is validated through the modeling of a real deployable boom, obtaining the same frequency modes and dynamical behavior."

abstract={In a previously reported work, generalized equations of motion were developed for the dynamic analysis of elastic mechanism systems. Emphasis was placed on the need for including vibration effects; these, until recently, had generally been neglected, primarily for reason of the complexity of the mathematical analysis of such systems. Finite element theory was used to facilitate the modeling of elastic mechanisms. In this work, Part I of two companion papers, an approach to the solution of the equations of motion is offered. Some related considerations are also discussed. Applications to the analysis and solution method are presented. To demonstrate generality, an example is selected wherein the geometrically complex follower link of a four-bar mechanism is modeled with quadrilateral finite elements. Part II of this paper presents an experimental investigation of an elastic four-bar mechanism.},

abstract={The transfer matrix method (TMM) can be a powerful tool for modeling flexible structures under feedback control. It is particularly well suited to modeling structures composed of serially connected elements. The TMM is capable of modeling continuous elements such as beams or flexible robot links without discretization. The ability to incorporate controller transfer functions into the transfer matrix model of the system makes it a useful approach for control design. A limitation of the traditional formulation of the TMM is that it can only model feedback where the actuators and sensors are strictly collocated. The primary contribution of this paper is an algorithm for modeling noncollocated feedback with the TMM. Two cases of noncollocated sensors are considered (upstream and downstream). The approach is experimentally verified on a flexible robot that has one upstream and one downstream sensor in its feedback loops.},

While being widely used by structural analysts, this method does, however, have certain limitations, particularly when used for the control design of large flexible structures. In this paper, a new formulation based on the FETM method is presented. The new method effectively overcomes the limitations in the original FETM method, and also allows an easy construction of reduced models that are tailored for the control design. Other advantages of this new method include the ability to extract open loop frequencies and mode shapes with less computation, and simplification of the design procedures for output feedback, constrained compensation, and decentralized control. The development of this new method and the procedures for generating reduced models using this method are described in detail and the role of the reduced models in control design is discussed through an illustrative example."

Uncertainties on the characteristic parameters of each substructure can be easily considered by the proposed generic and systematic multibody modeling technique, leading to a minimal LFT model. The uncertainty block has a direct link with the physical parameters avoiding non-physical parametric configurations. This approach is illustrated to analyze the attitude control system of a spacecraft fitted with a tiltable flexible solar panel. A very simple root locus allows the stability of the closed-loop system to be characterized for a complete revolution of the solar panel.}

The multi-body system is composed of a main body (hub) fitted with rigid and flexible appendages (solar panels, antennas, propellant tanks,...) and on-board angular momentums (flywheels, control moment gyros). Each appendage can be connected to the hub by a cantilever joint or a pivot joint. More generally, our method can be applied to any open mechanical chain. In our approach, the rigid six degrees of freedom (d.o.f) (three translational and three rotational) are treated all together. That is very convenient to build linear models of complex multi-body systems. Then, the dynamics model used to design AOCS, i.e. the model between forces and torques (applied on the hub) and angular and linear position and velocity of the hub, can be derived very easily. This model can be interpreted using block diagram representation.}

abstract={The subject of this work is the dynamics of a rotating spacecraft. The spacecraft is modeled as a main rigid body connected to two flexible solar panels. The orbital motion of the whole spacecraft with a constant angular velocity is considered, interacting with small rigid motions of the main body, and small elastic deformations and infinitesimal vibrations of the solar panels. A continuum approach based on the Rayleigh–Ritz discretization is used to describe the distributed flexibility in the spacecraft. Rayleigh–Ritz discretization functions used are the clamped modes of the solar panels. This method enables us to construct the impedance matrix of the whole system relating to the displacement of the main body and the external torque. A spectral expansion of this impedance matrix, in terms of these clamped modes is obtained in the frequency domain.
The numerical results presented show that for small values of orbital angular velocity, the vibration motion frequencies of the flexible parts (solar panels) are not perturbed substantially. Moreover, when great values of orbital angular velocity are simulated, these frequencies change considerably. The present investigation based on the Rayleigh–Ritz discretization shows the effect of the interaction between the orbital motion of the whole spacecraft and the vibration motions of the flexible parts.},
