abstract="It is the purpose of this article to present a short account of the linear theory of thermoelasticity using the style and notation of Gurtin's treatise, The Linear Theory of Elasticity2, preceding in this volume. While it would probably be possible to put together a thermoelastic counterpart to each of the results given there, considerations of space and time have caused extensive selection to be made.",
