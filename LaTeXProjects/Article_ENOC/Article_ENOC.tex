\abstract{The following guidelines have been prepared for authors of papers to be presented at the forthcoming ENOC 2020 in Lyon (France), July 5-10, 2020. 
They provide the rules for the preparation of Extended Abstracts (maximum 2 pages). Authors are requested to follow these guidelines in order to achieve uniformity in 
the presentation of the digital Proceedings. Participants of the previous ENOC 2017 in Budapest will benefit from their work, since the layout of the extended abstract and of 
the full paper are almost unchanged.}

\section{Manuscript preparation}

Conference participants are encouraged to submit papers from any area of Nonlinear Dynamics ranging from dynamical systems theory to emerging nonlinear 
dynamics-enabled engineering applications, within the context of theoretical and applied mechanics, applied mathematics, physics, acoustics, bio-engineering, etc.

The web site will be open for paper submission from June 18, 2019. 
The deadline for the submission of an extended abstract is \emph{December 15, 2019}. Contributors will be informed of the decision of 
the Scientific Committee and on the assignment 
of their paper to a Mini-Symposium by February 2020.\\ 
The paper must be in English, and should present material that is novel and preferably unpublished at the time of the Conference. Prospective
presenters are asked to submit their paper through the Conference web site. 
Submission of a paper consists in the electronic submission of a 2-page Extended Abstract (PDF format only). The layout of the 2-page Extended Abstract and the optional Full Paper should follow the style of this document, starting with a title, followed by the name(s) of author(s) and affiliation(s). 
\underline{The name of the presenting author should be underlined}.
The submission of the 6-page Full Paper is optional. If the contribution is accepted for publication but no Full Paper is submitted then the 2-page Extended Abstract will appear in the electronic Proceedings. 

\subsection{Electronic submission of an Abstract}

The Abstract must be submitted on-line using the abstract submission form available on the ENOC 2020 web site \cite{ENOC}. The Book of Abstracts/Full length papers will be available on the same web site \cite{ENOC}. Submissions will be accepted until \emph{December 15, 2019}.\\ 
The ENOC Committee will award two ENOC 2020 prizes, each consisting of 300 euro and a certificate, to the best two presentations given during ENOC 2020 by young scientists. Presenting authors wishing to be considered for this award should indicate their interest while submitting their paper online.

\emph{Eligibility:} 1) Candidates must have been born in 1985 or later. 2) Only candidates who have submitted a Paper for presentation at the Congress are eligible for this program.
3) One applicant per accepted paper.

\emph{Documents Required:} 1) Paper submission 2) Government issued identification proving age 3) Interest in being considered for an ENOC 2020 prize must be indicated online with paper submission.

A maximum of three authors is allowed for the presentation to be rewarded. In addition to the requirements for the ENOC 2020 Proceedings the prize recipients are invited to write a contribution with respect to their presentation to be published in the EUROMECH Newsletter. 

\subsection{Electronic submission of the Extended Abstract in PDF format}
The Extended Abstract will be used as the sole means of selection of papers for presentation at the Conference. \\
All accepted Extended Abstracts will be published in digital format. 
The Extended Abstract is limited to a maximum of two A4 pages (including figures) and it must be submitted as a PDF document. \textbf{WHEN PREPARING THE PDF FILE REMEMBER TO EMBED ALL THE FONTS} into your PDF file, use TrueType fonts as much as possible, and avoid any Asian fonts. If the reviewers cannot read your PDF file it is unlikely they will accept it.\\ 
The text should be written using Times New Roman font and should start with a title followed by the authors' names and affiliations. \underline{The name of the author presenting the paper should be underlined}. The title should appear 20 mm below the top edge of the page.  It should be brief, clear and descriptive.  Use all bold lower case letters starting with a capital centered on the width of the typing area. Leave one blank line after the title and another after the affiliation. A short summary (max. 250 words) should be given at the start of the text. \\
If the Extended Abstract is divided into sections and subsections, please adopt the format used here, in which first-level headings are centered in bold lower case letters (11 pt) and second level headings are left aligned in bold lower case letters (10 pt), starting with a capital. Do not number sections. The text should be single-spaced using 10-pt font. Begin paragraphs flush at the left margin without indentation.  The typing area of all pages should be 170 x 257 mm, leaving 20 mm margins on left, right, top and bottom. The total length of the Extended Abstract, including all figures and references if any, should be two pages. The contribution should be prepared as accurately and carefully as possible, much like a manuscript for journal submission.\\ 
In order to submit an Extended Abstract, all authors must use the ENOC 2020 online submission system, available via the ENOC 2020 homepage. All submissions must be uploaded and completed by \emph{December 15, 2019}.

\section{General guidelines}
Authors are urged to make their Extended Abstract as attractive as possible, much like a manuscript for journal submission. In the Extended Abstract, you are encouraged to use figures, 
diagrams, and photographs, centered and with captions in lower case letters (9 pt). The Extended Abstract will enable the reviewers and the Scientific Committee to decide upon 
the suitability of your paper for presentation at the Conference. It should contain the main assumptions, techniques and results, accompanied by background information 
about how your work relates to other work in the field. Only essential formulae and figures should be included and only key references need to be given. A communicative 
title, a clearly presented Extended Abstract will all assist the Scientific Committee in making a positive decision with regard to the acceptance of your paper.

\section{Oral presentation}
Papers selected for presentation as lectures will be arranged by subject into parallel sessions. A period of 15 minutes, plus 5 minutes discussion, will be allotted to each paper. 
Standard audio-visual equipment (data projector, screen, laser pointer and an audio system) will be available in each lecture room. Details regarding the Conference presentation 
facilities will be provided on the ENOC 2020 web site.

\section{Poster presentation}
Authors of papers selected for presentation in poster format will be expected to present their work concurrently with the aid of a A0 poster during a dedicated poster session. The poster session will start with a quick presentation of all posters, during which the PDF version of each poster will be displayed and each presenting author will be given a maximum of 90 seconds to provide an attractive overview of its poster. \\ 
The Conference will provide poster boards. The usable area of a poster panel will correspond the size of an A0 sheet, i.e., approximately 1.2 m (height) by 0.85m (width).\\ 
Posters should be prepared directly on one sheet. Be warned that posters made by taping together several sheets tend to look amateurish. The lettering should be large enough to be read by someone standing 2 m back from the poster and the following text sizes are suggested. Title: 2-3 cm; Authors' names and affiliations: 2 cm; Section headings (ABSTRACT, RESULTS, etc.): 2 cm. The text itself should be approximately 10 mm high.  The use of more diagrams, colour, and fewer words is recommended for clarity. Use phrases and short sentences in "bullet points". It is recommended that the poster be divided into sections:  a one or two sentence abstract; problem definition and/or aims; methods; results; conclusions.

\section{Conclusions}
Prepare Extended Abstract as a PDF file, visit the ENOC 2020 web page enoc2020.sciencesconf.org \cite{ENOC}, create a sciencesconf.org account (if you have not already done so), 
and submit your Abstract following the instructions. Confirmation by e-mail will be sent to your e-mail address.
