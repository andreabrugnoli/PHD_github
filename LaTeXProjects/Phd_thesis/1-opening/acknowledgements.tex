This incredible experience has finally come to an end. Certainly there is no ending without a beginning. I must therefore thank Daniel, Valérie and Denis for encouraging me to undertake this path and for always supporting and motivating me during these last three years. A sincere acknowledgment goes to Alessandro Macchelli and Yann Le~Gorrec, for the time devoted to reviewing this work and for their infectious passion for research and science. Boundless thanks go obviously to my family, which in any circumstance has always been by my side and has been able to direct me when the way forward was not clear. \\

These 5 years spent in France were absolutely memorable. Heartfelt thanks to Fabizio, who gave me a roof and educated me on the most arcane mysteries of mathematical thought. Thanks to the marvelous Italian-Spanish family (Albert, Andrea Ac., Anthea, Alessio, Antonio, Daniel Francesco M., Lorenzo, Luca M., Matteo, Raul, Sara) for making me feel at home and for spoiling me with their delicacies. Special thanks to Paolo, for his energy and enthusiasm, who made me understand how important it is to live fully, without fear of the unknown. The Italian family then expanded at the beginning of this PhD. The reckless Andrea An., Andrea G., Francesco T., Manfredo, Michele and Nina have been companions of many exciting adventures, as well as of idle days, where time seemed to stand still. Every hour spent with you has always been meaningful to me. In this extended family I met Francesco S. and I understood that affinities transcend any regional border. \\

Thanks to Adeline, Clément, Sebastien, Virgile I got to know French culture closely. I never felt like a stranger with them. Among the many experiences made in this doctorate, the stay in Brazil was undoubtedly the densest. Thanks to Flavio's generosity and Mauricio's good heart, I was able to live peacefully and discover that even in adversity you can always smile. \\

At ISAE I found many passionate people, who always had advice and a word to cheer me up. I refer to Michel, Ghislain and Xavier, Caroline, Nicolas, Michelle, Laurent, Guillame and Remy. Thanks to the friends of a lifetime, who have always been present: Andrea G., Bianca, Davide, Eugenio, Jacopo and Marta. \\

The end of this doctorate coincides with the beginning of a new adventure in the Netherlands. Here I was welcomed by a new family, this time Italian-French: I sincerely thank Federico, Luigi, Quentin, Davide and Sara for their extraordinary welcome.\\

Special thanks to Ionna, because with you I feel that becoming a better person is achievable.
