\section{Port-Hamiltonian distributed systems}

 For 1D linear PH systems with a generalized skew-adjoint system operator, \cite{legorrec2005} gives conditions on the assignment of boundary inputs and outputs for the system operator to generate a contraction
semigroup. The latter is instrumental to show well-posedness of a linear PH
system, see \cite{zwart2012}. Essentially, at most half the number of boundary port variables
can be imposed as control inputs for a well-posed PH system in 1D.
