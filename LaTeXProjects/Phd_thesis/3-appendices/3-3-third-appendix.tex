\chapter{Implementation using FEniCS and Firedrake}

In this appendix, the main tools needed for low-level manipulation of the {\sc{FEniCS}} and {\sc{Firedrake}} are illustrated. It is assumed to a recent version of {\sc{FEniCS}} and {\sc{Firedrake}} is avaiable, either through local installation (Anaconda and installation from source for {\sc{FEniCS}} and virtual Python environment for {\sc{Firedrake}}). Additional information concerning the installation can be found at \url{https://fenicsproject.org/download/} for {\sc{FEniCS}} and \url{https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html} for {\sc{FEniCS}}. The {\sc{FEniCS}} library possesses a vast documentation \cite{logg2012}. On the contrary the {\sc{Firedrake}} developers have not released a comprehensive book, and employ tutorials to illustrate the functioning of the library. For the illustrated boxes colored in red are used for {\textcolor{red}{\sc{FEniCS}} and blue for {\textcolor{blue}{\sc{Firedrake}}}.
