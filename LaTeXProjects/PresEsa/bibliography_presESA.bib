	abstract = {This article presents and validates a general framework to build a linear dynamic Finite Element-based model of large exible structures for integrated Control/Structure design. An extension of the Two-Input Two-Output Port (TITOP) approach is here developed. The authors had already proposed such framework for simple beam-like structures: each beam was considered as a TITOP sub-system that could be interconnected to another beam thanks to the ports. The present work studies bodies with multiple attaching points by allowing complex interconnections among several sub-structures in tree-like assembly. The TITOP approach is extended to generate NINOP (N-Input N-Output Port) models. A Matlab toolbox is developed integrating beam and bending plate elements. In particular a NINOP formulation of bending plates is proposed to solve analytic twodimensional problems. The computation of NINOP models using the outputs of a MSC/Nastran modal analysis is also investigated in order to directly use the results provided by a commercial finite element software. The main advantage of this tool is to provide a model of a multibody system under the form of a block diagram with a minimal number of states. This model is easy to operate for preliminary design and control. An illustrative example highlights the potential of the proposed approach: the synthesis of the dynamical model of a spacecraft with two deployable and  exible solar arrays.}
