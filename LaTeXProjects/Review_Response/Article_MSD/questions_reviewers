COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR:

Reviewer #1: A review on the paper â€žPort-Hamiltonian flexible multibody dynamics"
The authors wrote a very clear and interesting formulation for flexible multibody dynamics systems using the floating frame of reference formulation and the concepts of Port-Hamiltonian systems. The ideas are not completely new and many formulations on "special cases" exist in the literature, especially for rigid body systems and rigid body systems with a flexible link and similar. The paper is free of typos and in general of high quality.

Nevertheless, I have the following remarks:
a)	The paper starts with (partially) well known relations on the equations of motion of deformable bodies attached to a reference frame. The PDE-approach is commonly treated in the control theory, but mostly breaks down hereafter by introducing a discretization and some missing links in the otherwise concise derivations. Wouldn't the formulation be much clearer for the reader, if the derivations are shortened by starting with less common approaches?
b)	Ref. [39] on page 2 is outdated. There have been much publications since regarding model order reduction related to corotational formulations and inertial/absolute frame.
c)	The cross map operator is usually written as a tilde in multibody dynamics.
d)	While the formulation is really interesting and already commonly used for rigid body systems, I would like to see this formulation for general bodies, not for beams. The concept with beams is what many people treat in robotics, probably in a slightly different manner, but resulting in similar equations (cf. Bremer's projection equations). You state in the abstract "Thanks to the features of the pH framework, complex multibody systems are constructed in a modular way" - but this is the same, if you use the approach from robotics. Do you obtain different equations of motion?
e)	Eq. (29) is similar to the equations which people often use for flexible multibody dynamics. However, it is hard to see how the according matrices can be computed from the previous derivations. Thus, it would be advantageous, if you interpret these terms with respect to (mechanical) flexible multibody dynamics notation and if you can embed it into existing (common) formulations.
f)	Eq. (33) should be explained in more detail regarding the EA and EI terms, which might be natural due to the D{-1} term in the mass operator, but will be confusing for common readers.
g)	I am strongly missing comparison to other formulations and other multibody codes: are the analytical / numerical results the same? Is the performance higher?
h)	I am very much missing the "what does not work" and "restrictions" in the conclusions (e.g., does it work for (flexible) sliding joints or multimodal joints?), which should be present in any "new formulation". The proposed approach starts with a very general PDE formulation, but breaks down to beams in the end. Slider-crank and four bar mechanisms are shown, but no really "complex multibody systems". For those who would like to reproduce the formulation, they have a right to know, if it will work out for their application or it will not.




Reviewer #2: 
The authors present a port-Hamiltonian formulation for flexible multibody dynamics which is well-suited for implementation in modeling platforms like Simulink or Modelica. 

The formulation is clearly developed, in a systematic way, from energy considerations. 

Comments / remarks: 

1)	Can the authors explain what they understand by a "lossless" system? It is not a standard term in finite elements technology. 
2)	The text before equation (21) and (22) does not correspond with equations (21) and (22). Please, rephrase. 
3)	Page (4), before equation (4). Should be infinitesimal STRAIN instead of stress. 
4)	Constraints are imposed at the velocity level. It is well-known that a drift appears in this case. Are you using any stabilization ?
5)	Page 20, first paragraph section 6: four bar MECHANISM.
6)	In order to assess about the accuracy of solutions and quality of the approach, it would be important to include a convergence study. What are the typical time steps used in the analyses? Are you getting quadratic convergence ? What are typical cpu times comsumptions for the examples you are displaying ?
