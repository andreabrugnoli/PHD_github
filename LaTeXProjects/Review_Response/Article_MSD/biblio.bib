	abstract = "This paper describes a dynamic formulation of a straight beam finite element in the setting of the special Euclidean group SE(3). First, the static and dynamic equilibrium equations are derived in this framework from variational principles. Then, a non-linear interpolation formula using the exponential map is introduced. It is shown that this framework leads to a natural coupling in the interpolation of the position and rotation variables. Next, the discretized internal and inertia forces are developed. The semi-discrete equations of motion take the form of a second-order ordinary differential equation on a Lie group, which is solved using a Lie group time integration scheme. It is remarkable that no parameterization of the nodal variables needs to be introduced and that the proposed Lie group framework leads to a compact and easy-to-implement formulation. Some important numerical and theoretical aspects leading to a computationally efficient strategy are highlighted and discussed. For instance, the formulation leads to invariant tangent stiffness and mass matrices under rigid body motions and a locking free element. The proposed formulation is successfully tested in several numerical static and dynamic examples."

How to find an efficient accurate dynamics modeling method and its stable reliable numerical solving algorithm are the two core problems of flexible MSD. In this paper, the research status of modeling methods of flexible MSD in recent years is summarized first, including the selection of reference frames, the flexible body's kinematics descriptions, the deductions of dynamics equation, the model reduction techniques and the modeling methods of the contact/collision, uncertainty and multi-field coupling problems. Then, numerical solution technologies and their latest developments of flexible MSD are discussed in detail. Finally, the future research directions of modeling and numerical computation of flexible MSD are briefly prospected.},

	abstract = {Abstract Flexible multibody systems are governed by sets of non-linear differential-algebraic equations (DAE). The number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) required for accurate body flexibility modeling, as well as the presence of the algebraic constraint equations limit the simulation speed. Body-level model reduction and general-purpose system-level model reduction techniques do not result in optimal model dimension reduction and do not necessarily transform the DAE-set into a cheaper to solve set of ordinary differential equations, as opposed to model reduction techniques, such as Global Modal Parameterization (GMP), which are based on describing the system motion by the contribution of its dominant (configuration-dependent) system-level modal patterns. Their use as a simulation tool has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper investigates the influence of the modal content of the configuration-dependent mode set on the simulation accuracy through numerical experiments. By including the dynamically excited eigenmodes and static deformation patterns for DOFs in which the system is externally loaded, the system can be accurately represented by a very limited number of DOFs. Phenomena such as mode veering and mode crossing, in which the modal content of eigenmodes rapidly varies, can be expected to be problematic for such a description, which is confirmed with numerical experiments.

	journal={Multibody System Dynamics},
	year={2019},
	month={Nov},
	day={26},
	abstract={The Floating Frame of Reference Formulation (FFRF) is one of the most widely used methods to analyze flexible multibody systems subjected to large rigid-body motion but small strains and deformations. The FFRF is conventionally derived via a continuum mechanics approach. This tedious and circuitous approach, which still attracts attention among researchers, yields so-called inertia shape integrals. These unhandy volume integrals, arising in the FFRF mass matrix and quadratic velocity vector, depend not only on the degrees of freedom, but also on the finite element shape functions. That is why conventional computer implementations of the FFRF are laborious and error prone; they require access to the algorithmic level of the underlying finite element code or are restricted to a lumped mass approximation. This contribution presents a nodal-based treatment of the FFRF to bypass these integrals. Each flexible body is considered in its spatially discretized state ab initio, wherefore the integrals are replaced by multiplications by a constant finite element mass matrix. Besides that, this approach leads to a simpler and concise but rigorous derivation of the equations of motion. The steps to obtain the inertia-integral-free equations of motion (in 2D and 3D spaces) are presented in a clear and comprehensive way; the final result provides ready-to-implement equations of motion without a lumped mass approximation, in contrast to the conventional formulation.},
