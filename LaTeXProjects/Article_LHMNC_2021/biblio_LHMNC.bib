The class of considered systems are hyperbolic systems of two conservation laws in arbitrary spatial dimension and geometries. For these systems, a partitioned finite element method (PFEM) is derived, based on the integration by parts of one of the two conservation laws written in weak form. The non-linear one-dimensional shallow-water equation (SWE) is first considered as a motivation example. Then, the method is investigated on the example of the non-linear two-dimensional SWE. Complete derivation of the reduced finite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian system (pHs) is provided and numerical experiments are performed. Extensions to curvilinear (polar) coordinate systems, space-varying coefficients and higher-order pHs (Euler–Bernoulli beam equation) are provided.}",

	abstract = {In this two-parts paper, we present a systematic procedure to extend the known Hamiltonian model of ideal inviscid fluid flow on Riemannian manifolds in terms of Lie–Poisson structures to a port-Hamiltonian model in terms of Stokes-Dirac structures. The first novelty of the presented model is the inclusion of non-zero energy exchange through, and within, the spatial boundaries of the domain containing the fluid. The second novelty is that the port-Hamiltonian model is constructed as the interconnection of a small set of building blocks of open energetic subsystems. Depending only on the choice of subsystems one composes and their energy-aware interconnection, the geometric description of a wide range of fluid dynamical systems can be achieved. The constructed port-Hamiltonian models include a number of inviscid fluid dynamical systems with variable boundary conditions. Namely, compressible isentropic flow, compressible adiabatic flow, and incompressible flow. Furthermore, all the derived fluid flow models are valid covariantly and globally on n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds using differential geometric tools of exterior calculus.}

	abstract = {Part I of this paper presented a systematic derivation of the Stokes–Dirac structure underlying the port-Hamiltonian model of ideal fluid flow on Riemannian manifolds. Starting from the group of diffeomorphisms as a configuration space for the fluid, the Stokes–Dirac structure is derived by Poisson reduction and then augmented by boundary ports and distributed ports. The additional boundary ports have been shown to appear naturally as surface terms in the pairings of dual maps, always neglected in standard Hamiltonian theory. The port-Hamiltonian model presented in Part I corresponded only to the kinetic energy of the fluid and how its energy variables evolve such that the energy is conserved. In Part II, we utilize the distributed port of the kinetic energy port-Hamiltonian system for representing a number of fluid-dynamical systems. By adding internal energy we model compressible flow, both adiabatic and isentropic, and by adding constraint forces we model incompressible flow. The key tools used are the interconnection maps relating the dynamics of fluid motion to the dynamics of advected quantities.}
