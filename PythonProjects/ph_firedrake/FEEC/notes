For quadrilateral and hexahedral elements last coincidence matrix (i.e. D_1, D_2) is multiplied by the number of elements.

For simplicial elements a different variant leads to different coincidence matrices.

Attenzione: using project for initial condition may induce vibrations due to high frequency content --> use interpolate to alleviate the problem
