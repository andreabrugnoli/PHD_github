The differnce for the coincidence matrices is just in the top forms: Scaling for DG in structured meshes.

scaling = (total number of elements / total volume (3D) or area (2D))
so if we define h = L/(n_el 1D) then
scaling2D = 2*h^{-2} (as in Paul Kot. paper for coefficient of whitney forms)
and
scaling3D = 6*h^{-3}

Try extracting coincidence matrices in polar coordinates.
