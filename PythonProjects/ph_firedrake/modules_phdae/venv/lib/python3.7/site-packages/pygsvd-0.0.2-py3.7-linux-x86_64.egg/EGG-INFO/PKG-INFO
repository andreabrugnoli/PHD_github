Description: 
                    The gsvd module is a wrapper for the LAPACK generalized
                    singular value routines for double and complex double arrays.
                    The GSVD is a joint decomposition, which simultaneously diagonalizes
                    a pair of matrices. Intuitively, the decomposition finds a linear
                    subspace which most "overlaps" with the row space of the first
                    matrix and the null space of the second. The decomposition is useful
                    in certain regularization and clustering problems, and can be
                    used to derive solutions to the generalized eigenvalue problem.
