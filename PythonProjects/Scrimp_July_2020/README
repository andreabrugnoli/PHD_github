To install FEniCS, please check the FEniCS website for instructions depending on your platform:

https://fenicsproject.org

If your Python installation is based on anaconda, an easy way to install the Python libraries is to use conda functionalities. Please check the anaconda website for information related to conda and anaconda:

https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ 

To create a specific environment corresponding to the exact version that we have used, you may want to use one of these platform specific environment files:

> conda create --name zenodo  --file linux-64-spec-file.txt

or 

> conda create --name zenodo  --file osx-64-spec-file.txt

depending on your platform. To activate the resulting environment, please type:

> conda activate zenodo

You are then ready to use the Notebooks. Within the zenodo environment use

> jupyter notebook

and your Jupyter session should start.
