@article{Vu2016a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis GroupA geometric spatial reduction for the port-Hamiltonian models is presented in this paper. It is based on the projection which makes use of the symmetries and on the preservation of the ï¿½natural' power pairing for the considered system. Thanks to this reduction, an Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC-like) synthesis for infinite dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems is investigated. As for the finite dimensional case, a feedback control transforms the original model into a closed-loop target Hamiltonian model. Both distributed control and boundary control are used. The finite rank distributed control is determined to solve an average IDA-PBC matching equation. A backstepping boundary control is used to stabilize the matching error. The control model chosen to illustrate the approach is the so-called resistive diffusion equation for the radial diffusion of the poloidal magnetic flux.},
