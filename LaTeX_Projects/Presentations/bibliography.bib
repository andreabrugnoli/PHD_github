As a result of the interconnections algebraic constraints between the state variables commonly arise. This leads to the description of the system by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), i.e., a combination of ordinary differential equations with algebraic constraints. The basic point of view put forward in this survey paper is that the differential-algebraic equations that arise are not just arbitrary, but are endowed with a special mathematical structure; in particular with an underlying geometric structure known as a Dirac structure. It will be discussed how this knowledge can be exploited for analysis and control.},

The classical finite dimensional port Hamiltonian formulation of a dynamical system is generalized in order to cope with the distributed parameter and multivariable case. The resulting class of infinite dimensional systems is quite general, thus allowing the description of several physical phenomena, such as heat conduction, piezoelectricity and elasticity. Furthermore, classical PDEs can be rewritten within this framework. The key point is the generalization of the notion of finite dimensional Dirac structure in order to deal with an infinite dimensional space of power variables.},

	title = "Hamiltonian discretization of boundary control systems",
	abstract = "A fundamental problem in the simulation and control of complex physical systems containing distributed-parameter components concerns finite-dimensional approximation. Numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) usually assume the boundary conditions to be given, while more often than not the interaction of the distributed-parameter components with the other components takes place precisely via the boundary. On the other hand, finite-dimensional approximation methods for infinite-dimensional input–output systems (e.g., in semi-group format) are not easily relatable to numerical techniques for solving PDEs, and are mainly confined to linear PDEs. In this paper we take a new view on this problem by proposing a method for spatial discretization of boundary control systems based on a particular type of mixed finite elements, resulting in a finite-dimensional input–output system. The approach is based on formulating the distributed-parameter component as an infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian system, and exploiting the geometric structure of this representation for the choice of appropriate mixed finite elements. The spatially discretized system is again a port-Hamiltonian system, which can be treated as an approximating lumped-parameter physical system of the same type. In the current paper this program is carried out for the case of an ideal transmission line described by the telegrapher’s equations, and for the two-dimensional wave equation.",

	abstract = "The theory of port-Hamiltonian systems provides a framework for the geometric description of network models of physical systems. It turns out that port-based network models of physical systems immediately lend themselves to a Hamiltonian description. While the usual geometric approach to Hamiltonian systems is based on the canonical symplectic structure of the phase space or on a Poisson structure that is obtained by (symmetry) reduction of the phase space, in the case of a port-Hamiltonian system the geometric structure derives from the interconnection of its sub-systems. This motivates to consider Dirac structures instead of Poisson structures, since this notion enables one to define Hamiltonian systems with algebraic constraints. As a result, any power-conserving interconnection of port-Hamiltonian systems again defines a port-Hamiltonian system. The port-Hamiltonian description offers a systematic framework for analysis, control and simulation of complex physical systems, for lumped-parameter as well as for distributed-parameter models.",

	title = "A Port-Hamiltonian Approach to Distributed Parameter Systems",
	abstract = "This thesis aims to provide a mathematical framework for the modeling and analysis of open distributed parameter systems. From a mathematical point of view this thesis merges the approach based on Hamiltonian modeling of open distributed-parameter systems, employing the notion of port-Hamiltonian systems, with the semigroup approach of infinite-dimensional systems theory. The Hamiltonian representation provides powerful analysis methods (e.g. for stability), and it enables the use of Lyapunov-stability theory and passivity-based control. The semigroup approach has been widely applied in the analysis of distributed parameter systems and it has facilitated the extension of some notions from finite-dimensional system theory to the infinite-dimensional case. One of the key points of the port-Hamiltonian formulation is the structure of the mathematical model obtained. By exploiting this structure, the port-Hamiltonian approach allows to deal with classes of systems, which provide a relative new point of view in the analysis of distributed parameter systems. In this thesis the port-Hamiltonian formulation is mainly used for the analysis of 1D-boundary control systems. These are systems in which the input (or part of it) acts on the boundary of the spatial domain. In these cases it is possible to parameterize the selection of the inputs (boundary conditions) and outputs by the selection of two matrices in such a way that the resulting system is passive. In this case these matrices determine the supply rate of the passive system, making it easy, in particular, to obtain impedance passive and scattering passive systems. In fact, as it is shown, these matrices can be used to determine further properties of the system, such as stability, controllability, and observability. Furthermore, it is shown that this approach already covers a very large class of 1D-systems. This thesis treats mainly two broad classes of systems. One corresponds to systems where the dissipation phenomena is not present and the other includes systems with some type of dissipation (e.g. heat or mass transfer, damping). These classes can, in turn, be divided into subclasses according to the properties of the structure, to provide further tools for the analysis of such systems. Thus the structure of the resulting models forms the basis for the development of general analysis (and control) techniques. In fact, it is shown that for some classes of systems it is possible to easily determine some of their fundamental properties (e.g. existence of solutions, stability, Riesz basis property). In this thesis we provide simple tools for the analysis of these properties for some classes of systems.",
